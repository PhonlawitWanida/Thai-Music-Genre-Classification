# Thai-Music-Genre-Classification
Audio classification project analyzing traditional Thai music identities. Utilizes Python and Librosa for feature extraction (MFCCs, Chroma) to train a Random Forest model.
💻 How to Run (Google Colab)
1. Inference (Predicting Genre)
Open notebooks/Run_on_web.ipynb in Google Colab.

Load the pre-trained model from the models/ folder.

Upload your .mp3 or .wav file.

Run the cells to see the predicted Thai Region.

2. Training a New Model
Open notebooks/Project_DE242_Music_Genre_Classification.ipynb.

Upload your dataset into the Dataset/ folder structure.

Run the pipeline to process audio, extract features, and retrain the Random Forest model.

⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository does not include the actual audio dataset due to copyright restrictions.

For Training: Please organize your own audio files into folders named by region (e.g., Dataset/North/, Dataset/South/).
